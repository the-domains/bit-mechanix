My first line of code was written in BASIC, on an Atari 800\. That was in 1984, I think. Before long, I was tracking my record album collection with a flat-file database that I wrote in class. It wasn't enough for me that the code worked and that I had received my grade for the assignment (an "A", naturally). I would spend hours after school refining the code, making it elegant and easy-to-read, until my teacher kicked me out so that he could go home. 

I was hooked.
